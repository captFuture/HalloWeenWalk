# HalloWeenWalk

This is a small HalloWeen project where some LED torches are created/modified and a MasterTorch can change light settings on all connected torches of people for a thrilling experience.

Nobody of the participants knows that his torch can be switched on and off remotely, as well as some flicker patterns and slight color options.

Based on Wemos D1 Mini (esp8266) Microcontrollers and Ws8212B RGB led pixels.

Used Libraries:
FastLED (https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
Painless Mesh (https://gitlab.com/painlessMesh/painlessMesh)

There are 2 Platformio projects in subfolders, a MasterTorch and the SlaveTorch(es)
